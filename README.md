  - Cloudflare D1 (SQLite database for session/technique data)
  - Cloudflare KV (caching and quick access storage)
- **Data Flow**: 
  - User interactions ‚Üí API endpoints ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí Database storage ‚Üí Real-time feedback

## Core Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Offensive Hypnosis Module
- **Rapid Induction**: Instant trance techniques with pattern interrupts
- **Covert Hypnosis**: Conversational induction without awareness
- **Embedded Commands**: Hidden suggestions with NLP patterns
- **Confusion Techniques**: Cognitive overload for bypassing critical factor
- **Script Generation**: AI-powered custom hypnotic script creation

### ‚úÖ Defensive Hypnosis Module
- **Real-time Analysis**: Detect hypnotic patterns in text/conversation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify embedded commands, confusion techniques, NLP manipulation
- **Counter-Measures**: Pattern interrupt, conscious analysis, reality anchoring
- **Emergency Protocol**: "They got me" instant extraction system
- **Mental Shield**: Visualization-based protection protocols

### ‚úÖ Practice Mode
- **AI Agents**: 
  - Susceptible subjects (varying levels of suggestibility)
  - Resistant subjects (analytical and defensive)
  - Offensive masters (attempting to hypnotize the user)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Agents evolve and adapt to user techniques
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor skill development and effectiveness

### ‚úÖ Core Commands
- `"Analyze this moment"` - Context and truth detection
- `"Ground me"` - Trigger grounding protocol
- `"Scramble this"` - Detect and neutralize hypnotic NLP
- `"Update the case file"` - Log interaction to memory
- `"Extract what matters"` - Summarize key evidence
- `"They got me"` - Emergency extraction protocol

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Hono (lightweight, edge-native)
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers/Pages
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Cache**: Cloudflare KV
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Modular AI agent system
- **Development**: Vite + TypeScript
- **Process Manager**: PM2

## User Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Visit the Platform**: Navigate to the development URL
2. **Initialize System**: Click "Initialize System" to activate the platform
3. **Choose Your Mode**:
   - **Offensive Mode**: Learn and practice hypnotic techniques
   - **Defensive Mode**: Protect yourself from hypnotic manipulation
   - **Practice Mode**: Train with AI agents

### Offensive Mode Usage
1. Select a technique (Rapid Induction, Covert Hypnosis, etc.)
2. Review the generated script and instructions
3. Practice the technique in a safe environment
4. Use the Script Generator for custom hypnotic sessions

### Defensive Mode Usage
1. Activate real-time protection
2. Paste suspicious text/conversation for analysis
3. Review threat assessment and counter-measures
4. Practice defensive techniques like Pattern Interrupt

### Practice Mode Usage
1. Select your practice partner (Susceptible/Resistant/Master)
2. Choose difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert)
3. Start the session and interact with the AI agent
4. Observe agent responses and adaptation
5. Track your progress and skill development

### Emergency Protocol
- **Activation**: Say or type "They got me"
- **Actions**: 
  1. Immediate pattern disruption
  2. Grounding sequence activation
  3. Reality checks and anchoring
  4. Safe extraction steps
  5. Recovery guidance
